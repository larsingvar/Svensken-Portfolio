        On March 15, 2025, I embarked on an exciting journey into the world of coding, starting with HTML and CSS. It
        was the beginning of something new, a gateway into the vast universe of web development. At first, everything
        seemed overwhelming—the structure of an HTML document, the different tags, and how CSS styles could bring a
        webpage to life. But with curiosity and determination, I delved into learning the basics, experimenting with
        code, and seeing my first web pages come to life.

        I remember the excitement of writing my very first lines of code, creating a simple webpage with a heading, a
        paragraph, and a few links. It was basic, yet it felt like magic—turning raw code into something visually
        tangible on a browser. As I progressed, I explored different HTML elements, learning about forms, tables, and
        how to structure content properly.

        CSS was another adventure in itself. The ability to style a webpage, control layouts, and add animations
        fascinated me. I experimented with colors, fonts, margins, paddings, and different display properties. The
        journey into responsive design opened up even more possibilities, teaching me how to make websites look good on
        any device. Flexbox and Grid became essential tools, and I found myself diving deeper into modern web design
        techniques.

        As days turned into weeks, I started working on small projects—creating simple landing pages, designing personal
        portfolios, and even trying to replicate famous websites just for practice. I learned the importance of clean
        and structured code, proper indentation, and how to debug issues when something didn’t look or function as
        expected.

        One of the most exciting aspects of my journey was discovering how powerful CSS could be when combined with
        creativity. I experimented with animations, hover effects, and transitions, making my web pages more interactive
        and engaging. The feeling of making a button change color smoothly or adding a fade-in effect to an image was
        incredibly rewarding.

        Through online tutorials, coding challenges, and community forums, I continued expanding my knowledge. I
        realized that coding is not just about writing lines of code; it's about problem-solving, creativity, and
        continuously learning new techniques and best practices.

        As I look ahead, I know this is just the beginning. The world of web development is vast, with so much more to
        explore—JavaScript, front-end frameworks like React, and even back-end technologies. But no matter how far I go,
        I will always remember that it all started on March 15, 2025, with HTML and CSS, and an eagerness to create
        something amazing on the web.
